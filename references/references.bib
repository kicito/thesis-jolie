  abstract  = {Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.},

In this paper we propose SOCK, a three-layered calculus equipped with a formal semantics, for addressing all the basic mechanisms of service communication and composition. The main contribute of our work is the development of a formal framework where the service design is decomposed into three fundamental parts: the behaviour, the declaration and the composition where each part can be designed independently of the other ones.},
