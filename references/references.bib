      this chapter reviews the history of software architecture,
      the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first,
      and microservices later. Finally,
      open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline,
      while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition,
      we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.},

      the declaration and the composition where each part can be designed independently of the other ones.},
