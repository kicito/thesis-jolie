Dear all, 

As the approaching deadline (tomorrow midnight), I would like to send you the partially fix after Saverio's comment and the citing/referencing fix. Just in case that if you have some time to look at the citing/referencing, as it was error in last draft.

I am really appreciated your detailed comments as it helped me rethink on what was on my mind when I was writing the first draft. Although, I thought that I would be able to resolve all the comments last night, but unfortunately, I couldn't meet my self-expectation again. I am sorry for the inconvenient.
