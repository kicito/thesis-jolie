Dear all, 

As the approaching deadline (tomorrow midnight), I would like to send you the partially fix version after Saverio's comment and the referencing to you. Just in case that if you have some time to look at the referencing, as it was error in last draft.

I am really appreciated your detailed comments as it helped me rethink on what was on my mind when I was writing the first draft. Although, I thought that I would be able to resolve all the comments last night, but unfortunately, I couldn't meet my self-expectation again. I am sorry for the inconvenient.
