\section{ Name Resolution }

The introduction of Symbol Table allows Jolie interpreter parses the definition referencing in abstract syntax by using a lazy evaluation strategy. This benefits Jolie developer by allowing symbol referencing without worry about definition order. To illustrate the problem Jolie had before, consider the following source code:

\begin{listing}[ht]
    \lstset{language=Jolie,
        style=codeStyle
    }
    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb]{definitionOrder.ol}
define bar{
    foo
}

define foo {
    bar
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}

The interpreter will fail to parse this source code since the parser cannot find a procedure definition \texttt{foo} when an attempt to parse token foo inside procedure \texttt{bar}.
By introducing name resolution to the current workflow, it is possible to write and use definitions without a concern on order. During the parsing phase, Jolie interpreter assigns an empty named symbol object, which will be resolved to an expected abstract syntax by performing name resolution.
