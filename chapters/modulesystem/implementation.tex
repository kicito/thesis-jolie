After the discussion of every new components of Jolie's module system. We are moving in to  The workflow of interpreting a Jolie module system source become:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The command-line configuration get parsed, this include locate the executing target file.
    \item The source code get parsed in parser, where the AST is created.
          \textbf{\item The syntax table is created from AST, both combined into a main Module Record
    \item The dependent Module Records with their initial Symbol Table (first step) gets crawled by Module Crawler.
    \item The symbol tables are revisited and external symbol entries gets fully filled (second step).
    \item The missing program's reference get solve from name resolution, and resolved the type link definition.}
    \item The program's component nodes in AST get verified it's semantic.
    \item The interpretation tree, or the runtime executable object, is generated from AST \textbf {of the main service definition}.
    \item The CommCore is initialized from the communication ports configuration declared in AST node.
    \item The embedding services is initialized and communication related variable is set.
    \item The runtime execute init/main procedure definition process.
\end{enumerate}
