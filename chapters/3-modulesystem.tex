\chapter{Jolie Module System}

In this chapter, we present the module system for Jolie.
Similarly to how we presented python module system, we will walk-though the definitions, components, import mechanism, and lastly the redesign of Jolie's code file layout.

\section{Definitions}

Before diving into the details, it is beneficial to define a definition of components in a module system. In Jolie:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
          A \texttt{symbol} is a declaration of file level definition AST node. Symbol target is defined along with a module target in the import statement to specify which definition node it to be imported.
    \item
          A \texttt{module} is defined as a Jolie execution code in the file system. A module is a file contains symbols and the execution target for running the jolie code.
    \item
          A \texttt{package} is defined as either a directory in the file system or a file. A package role in the jolie module system is a place to hold the modules and can be part of the module target. A file with \texttt{.jap} extension, the Jolie's JAR-like achieve. is consider as a package which it's entry can be referred as a module.
\end{itemize}
